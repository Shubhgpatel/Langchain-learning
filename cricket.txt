CRICKET: A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE

INTRODUCTION
Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players on a field with a 22-yard pitch at its center. Known for its strategic depth and rich traditions, cricket is particularly popular in countries like India, England, Australia, Pakistan, South Africa, the West Indies, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.

BRIEF HISTORY
Cricket originated in England during the 16th century and became the national sport by the 18th century. The first international match was played between the United States and Canada in 1844. The sport spread globally through the British Empire, and the first Test match was played between Australia and England in 1877. The International Cricket Council (ICC), founded in 1909, now governs the sport worldwide.

BASIC RULES AND GAMEPLAY

The Pitch and Field
The cricket field is typically oval-shaped with a rectangular 22-yard pitch in the center. At each end of the pitch are wooden stumps called wickets, consisting of three vertical posts with two small wooden pieces (bails) balanced on top.

Teams and Positions
Each team has 11 players. When batting, two players are on the field at a time. The fielding team has all 11 players positioned strategically around the field, including a bowler and wicketkeeper.

Scoring Runs
Batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. They can also score boundaries: four runs if the ball crosses the boundary after bouncing, or six runs if it clears the boundary without bouncing.

Getting Out
A batsman can be dismissed in several ways:
- Bowled: The ball hits the stumps
- Caught: A fielder catches the ball before it bounces
- LBW (Leg Before Wicket): The ball would have hit the stumps but hits the batsman's leg instead
- Run out: The fielding team breaks the stumps while batsmen are running
- Stumped: The wicketkeeper breaks the stumps when the batsman is out of the crease
- Hit wicket: The batsman accidentally hits their own stumps

FORMATS OF CRICKET

Test Cricket
The longest and most traditional format, Test matches last up to five days with each team batting twice. This format tests endurance, skill, and strategy. Teams wear white clothing and play with a red ball.

One Day International (ODI)
Each team faces a limited number of overs (typically 50 overs per side). Matches are completed in a single day, usually lasting about 8 hours. Teams wear colored clothing and play with a white ball.

Twenty20 (T20)
The shortest format where each team plays 20 overs. A match typically lasts about 3-4 hours. This fast-paced format has become extremely popular, spawning lucrative leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL), and Caribbean Premier League (CPL).
